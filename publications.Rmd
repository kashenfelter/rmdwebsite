_Navigating the World with GIS: A Companion for World Regional Geography_ is a co-authored textbook with Sean Crotty that includes nine online GIS exercises to be used in introductory geography courses, each covering major thematic issues in different parts of the world.  The exercises are an excellent way to introduce undergraduates to GIS concepts, and require no technical background outside of an ability to operate a web browser.  The book is available from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Navigating-World-GIS-Companion-Geography/dp/1465284915) and [the publisher, Kendall Hunt](https://he.kendallhunt.com/product/navigating-world-gis-companion-world-regional-geography), where you also can obtain an evaluation copy.
