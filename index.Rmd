I am an Assistant Professor of Geography and Director of the [Center for Urban Studies](http://urbanstudies.tcu.edu/) at [Texas Christian University](http://www.tcu.edu).  My research interests include US immigration politics, the demography of cities and suburbs, and demographic data visualization.  At TCU, I teach courses in human geography, Geographic Information Systems, and data analysis.
